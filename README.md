## End-to-End Example: "Remote React Developer Jobs" Market Research

Prompt in Kiro:
```
    Search for "remote React developer jobs" on Google,
    scrape the top 5 job listing websites, extract job titles, companies,
    salary ranges, and required skills.
    Create a CSV with this data and generate a Python script that analyzes
    average salaries and most common requirements.
```
Kiro‚Äôs Steps:

- Uses ```search_engine``` to get live job-board links.
- Bulk scrapes (falls back to single-site scraping as needed).
- Auto-parses to ```remote_react_jobs.csv```.
- Generates ```analyze_react_jobs.py```‚Äîa complete analytics script.
- Produces ```react_jobs_analysis_report.txt``` (summary) and ```react_jobs_analysis.png``` (visual insights).

Result:
Structured, analysis-ready, live labor market data for React remote jobs, including titles, employers, salaries, locations, skills, and job-board source.

## How It Works

1. Kiro interprets your intent and plans a workflow, leveraging MCP tools to fetch and process live data.
2. Bright Data‚Äôs MCP server provides:
    - ```search_engine```: Fresh Google/Bing/Yandex SERPs.
    - ```scrape_as_markdown```: Clean markdown conversion.
    - ```scrape_batch```: Bulk, adaptive page scraping.
    - ```web_data_amazon_product```: Structured Amazon product data (for other scenarios!).
3. Automated extraction, data cleaning, CSV save, and Python analytic script generation‚Äîall from a single prompt.

## Setup Tutorial: Kiro + Bright Data MCP

1. Install and Launch Kiro

    - Request access at https://kiro.dev and follow install instructions.
    - Start Kiro‚Äîcomplete the onboarding wizard.

2. Create a Bright Data Account

    - Go to https://brightdata.com and sign up.
    - In the sidebar, open the MCP section, then choose Self-hosted mode.

3. Copy Your MCP Server Config

    - Copy the config block shown in your Bright Data portal.
    - Paste only the JSON (not surrounded by code fences) if pasting into a UI.
    Example:
```
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "Bright Data": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"],
              "env": {
                "API_TOKEN": "<your_api_token_here>"
              }
            }
          }
        }
```
4. Add the MCP Server to Kiro

    - In Kiro, open any folder/project.
    - In the sidebar, find the Kiro section > MCP SERVERS.
    - Remove the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù server, and paste your config in (as above).
    - Wait for status to turn Connected.

5. Test the Integration

    - Click on any MCP tool (e.g., search_engine) in Kiro.
    - You should see live results or a tool GUI in chat.

## Run Your First Automated Task

Prompt Example:
```
    Search for "remote React developer jobs" on Google, scrape the top 5 job listing websites, extract job titles, companies, salary ranges, and required skills. Create a CSV file with this data and generate a Python script that analyzes average salaries and most common requirements.
```
Kiro will:
- Call each MCP tool to fetch, scrape, and process job data
- Save as ```remote_react_jobs.csv```
- Generate ```analyze_react_jobs.py``` for analytics

Run Analysis Locally:
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python analyze_react_jobs.py

Results:
- react_jobs_analysis_report.txt (text summary)
- react_jobs_analysis.png (charts/visualizations)
```
